# Explainable-Federated-Learning-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
This repository contains the full source code and experimental setup for my disseration titled: Security of E-healthcare Data through Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and Machine Learning (ML). It includes the implementation of an Explainable Federated Learning (XFL) framework for private and interpretable breast cancer diagnosis using TensorFlow Federated and SHAP.
